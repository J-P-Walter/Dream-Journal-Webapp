# Dream-Journal

This is my first full stack project. It is based on the MERN architecture and the idea came to me as I listened to my girlfriend tell me about her crazy dreams, which she will sometimes write down in a notebook. I figured why not turn it into a project.

You can find the finished project [here](https://jp-dream-journal.netlify.app/). \
It was deployed using Netlify for the client side and Heroku for the api side.\
There are still many things that could be implemented (first thing that comes to mind is a login system) and I am sure it could be optimized but I am extremely happy with the results. The project in its whole took me a little less than a standard work week, and I gained a lot of knowledge from more HTML/CSS practice to more experience in React to Express apis and CRUD architecture for using a database.
