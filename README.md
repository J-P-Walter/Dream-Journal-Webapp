# Dream-Journal

This is my first full stack project. It is based on the MERN architecture and the idea came to me as I listened to my girlfriend tell me about her crazy dreams, which she will sometimes write down in a notebook. I figured why not turn it into a project.

This project is nowhere near finished, but will serve to help continue to teach me some new technologies.
