# Dream-Journal (Broken due to Heroku no longer having free hosting)

This is my first full stack project. It is based on the MERN architecture and the idea came to me as I listened to my girlfriend tell me about her crazy dreams, which she will sometimes write down in a notebook. I figured why not turn it into a project.

You can find the finished project [here](https://jp-dream-journal.netlify.app/). \
It was deployed using Netlify for the client side and Heroku for the api side.\
There are still many things that could be implemented (first thing that comes to mind is a login system) and I am sure it could be optimized but I am extremely happy with the results. The project in its whole took me a little less than a standard work week, and I gained a lot of knowledge: from more HTML/CSS practice to more experience in React to Express APIs and CRUD architecture for using a database.
